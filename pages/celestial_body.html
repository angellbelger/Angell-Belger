              <p> 
                It was the end of 2019, and my vacation was approaching. I decided to leave Osternack, the town where I lived, and take refuge in Nowhere, a distant countryside village. My only goal was to escape the noise and chaos of the big city and recover from an illness whose cause remained a mystery. Unknown to most in that region, I arrived without knowing that something meaningful was about to happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s when I met Ally—a girl who would soon become one of my closest friends. She was a unique blend of restlessness, recklessness, and, surprisingly, a touch of charming foolishness. This peculiar combination—so different from my own personality—ended up strengthening our bond in ways I didn’t expect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her mind always seemed occupied with random worries, and she constantly came up with last-minute invitations to go out. In the end, I usually gave in—after all, entertainment options in that small town were scarce. Our friendship grew quickly, despite her parents’ disapproval. That only pushed us to explore hidden places, searching for moments that could help us forget the world outside. Both of us carried an inner chaos we didn’t fully understand, let alone know how to escape. And while I tried to enjoy those moments, deep down, my mind stayed firmly fixed on my personal goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                One unforgettable moment came when our friend Sibelle took a candid photo that perfectly captured the contrast between our personalities. When I pointed this out to Ally, she agreed with me—except for the part where I called her an idiot.
              </p>
              <p>

              <div class="post-thumb">

              </div>
              <p>
                At some point during that time, Ally ran away from home and secretly took refuge at my place. She stayed hidden there for a while, making things complicated—especially since I was preparing to become a police officer. I had to take care of her because she was my friend, and honestly, I was going through my own difficult phase. Yet, those days weren’t without their lighter moments. We played cards, argued over silly things, and sometimes she would just sit there quietly, smiling as she listened to me play the violin.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                Obviously, this situation couldn’t last forever. After a week, her father pressured me to send her back. It felt like leading a lamb straight into the wolf’s den, fully aware of what was waiting for her.
              </p>
              <p>
                Soon after, the pandemic lockdown was announced, and everything changed. Ally was trapped at home and lost her phone while trying to reach me. With no other way to communicate, we turned to letters. It was old-fashioned, but somehow fitting for the strange times we were living in. I’d sneak out at dawn to retrieve the letters she left hidden near her house and leave mine in the same place. Since her time outside was limited, she usually wrote late at night and grabbed my replies whenever she found a brief window of opportunity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The whole atmosphere back then—global terror, empty streets, frequent blackouts, and the constant fear of the unknown—created a bizarre, almost medieval feeling, as if the modern world had suddenly collapsed and thrown us back into another era. It felt like we were living through the end of the world, somewhere in the 18th century. And still, we endured.
              </p>
              <p>
                But eventually, my mind grew restless, interfering with the goals I had set for myself. That’s when I made the hard choice: to cut all ties and leave everything behind. And just like that, we lost contact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Years later, Ally reappeared with a new phone. During a brief video call—one that surprised her, both because of the reasons behind my disappearance and because of the eccentric personality she had always admired and missed—I noticed several changes in her appearance. Her hair was dyed and slightly shorter. Her skin had darkened by two shades. Looking more closely, I saw the ends of her hair were split, suggesting she hadn’t been to a salon for about two months. She had also gained some weight—around seven kilos, I estimated. When I mentioned all this, she was stunned to see how accurate I was.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/ally/using-a-cellphone.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Angell:<br> — Dyed hair... a bit shorter... probably about two months since your last visit to the salon... looks like you’ve gained around     seven kilos... and your skin’s a couple of shades darker.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">Ally:<br> — Wow!<br>I actually gained twelve kilos and lost five...
                It’s been two months since I went to the salon...
                And yeah, my skin darkened a bit, but it’s slowly going back to normal...
                That was... impressive.<br>
              </p>
                <p class="mb-0"></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                After a few more conversations, I could feel Ally’s excitement about reliving old times. But my mind was somewhere else—locked onto my personal goals and especially on my decision to return to Osternack, the town I had left behind two years earlier. When I finally shared my decision with her, I saw the sadness on her face. And soon after, she disappeared again—this time, moving to another city.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through all the twists, distance, and moments of silence between us, I stayed true to my resolve. Like a chess player navigating the board of destiny, I remained focused. My mind—unflinching and strategically disciplined—refused to be swayed by nostalgia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like in chess, where sacrifices are necessary to reach checkmate, my sacrifices weren’t visible to others—but they were essential to stay on course. What some mistook for emotional distance was, in truth, unwavering dedication to a vision that only I could see.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Ally let herself drift into the warmth of memories, I continued calculating every move. Our friendship—tested by distance and change—became a mental battlefield where every step was deliberate, every choice necessary. My return to Osternack—like a king moving boldly to the center of the board—wasn’t just a decision; it was the culmination of silent sacrifices made in pursuit of a larger goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we said goodbye, with the sound of Ally’s footsteps fading as she headed toward another city, I understood that behind every carefully measured action lay a quiet appreciation for the complex puzzle that life had become. Like in chess—where no two games are the same—my journey pressed on, shaped by every choice, every loss, and every sacrifice needed to reach the checkmate that awaited me in the next chapter of destiny.
