              <p>
                It was the end of 2019, and my vacation was approaching. I decided to leave Osternack, the town where I lived, to take refuge in Nowhere, a distant country town. My only objective was to get away from the hustle and bustle of the big city for a while and recover from an unknown illness that I had developed. Still unknown in that region, something special was about to happen. That's when I met Ally, a girl who would become one of my best friends. She was a unique mix of agitation, recklessness and, surprisingly, a dash of idiocy. This peculiar combination, theoretically opposite to my personality, strengthened our friendship in an unexpected way.
              </p>
              <p>
                With her mind occupied by other concerns, Ally always came up with invitations to go out, and, in the end, I ended up giving in; after all, entertainment options were limited. Our friendship developed quickly, despite her parents' disapproval, which drove us to explore secret places in search of something capable of making us forget the world. We both carried an inner chaos that we wanted to escape. As I tried to Savor these moments, behind the scenes, my thoughts remained firmly cantered on my own personal plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                An iconic scene came about when a friend of ours named Sibelle captured a candid photo that brilliantly illustrated the contrast in our personalities. When he mentioned this to her, he agreed, except for the adjective "idiot".
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/angellbelger_19-year-old_young_man_straight_hair_with_a_calm_an_5004c360-5a6d-4a0d-9dcf-0ac2989a9423.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>
                Within this context, there was a period in which Ally even ran away from home and secretly took refuge in my residence. Obviously, this situation would not last forever. After a week, I was coerced by her father to return it. The sensation was like leading a sheep into the home of a wolf, who awaited his imminent arrival.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/angellbelger_19_year_old_girl_with_a_suitcase_in_her_hand_weari_d0d5e96d-4d4e-491e-8fde-7973a48100e1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>
                With the announcement of lockdown due to the pandemic, our lives changed drastically. Ally was locked in her house and lost her cell phone when trying to connect with me. Our conversations were limited to letters, a way we found to continue keeping in touch. I would go out at dawn to get the letters she left hidden for me near her residence, and I would leave mine in the same place. As she didn't have much time to do this, she wrote the letters at night. When she had the opportunity for a few minutes, she left and collected my letters in the secret location.
              </p>
              <p>
                The entire context of that period of terror, not just local but global, created a sense of medieval connection in a collapsing modern world. Deserted streets, constant lack of energy and fear of the unknown transported us to a bygone era, as if we were experiencing the end of the world in the 18th century. Still, we persist.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was a moment when my mind started to bother me, getting in the way of the goals I had in mind. That's when I decided to cut all ties and forget about all this, and we lost contact.
              </p>
              <p>
                Years later, Ally reappeared with a cell phone. During a brief video call, which was enough to surprise her (not only because of the reasons that led me to do all that, but also because of my eccentric personality that she admired and missed so much), I noticed changes in her appearance: dyed hair, shorter and a different skin tone, about two shades darker. When analysing in detail, I noticed frayed strands of hair, suggesting a trip to the hairdresser about two months ago, and a subtle physical transformation, resulting in 7 kg more. Upon questioning her, my deductions were confirmed. It was a reunion full of revelations for a friendship that has stood the test of time and circumstances.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/angellbelger_a_beautiful_18_year_old_woman__black_hair__lying_i_2a3cc9b5-c730-4815-ae2f-1c6d62d36428.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Angell:<br> — Hair dyed and a little shorter, it's probably been about 3 months since you've been to the salon, you must have gained about 7 kg, and your skin has darkened a few tones</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Ally:<br> — Darn!<br>I gained 12 kilos and lost 5 kilos...<br>2 months without going to the salon...<br>My skin has darkened a little, but it's getting back to its previous tone.<br>That was impressive...</p>
                <p class="mb-0"></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                After a few additional conversations, I noticed Ally's enthusiasm for reliving past experiences. However, my mind was firmly focused on my personal goals and the desire to return to Osternack, the town I had been away from for two years. When sharing my decision, I noticed her sad expression, and she disappeared once again, this time heading to another city.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/angellbelger_woman_on_the_ground_crying_while_20-year-old_man_w_09c366a0-8003-44df-82a7-7c4af398f25c.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>
                In the face of all the twists and turns and revelations along this journey with Ally, I remained steadfast in my resolve, like a chess player moving through the pieces of destiny. My mind, unflappable and strategically focused on my personal goals, did not give in to the temptation of getting lost in the nostalgic corners of the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like the player who sacrifices pieces to achieve checkmate, my sacrifices were invisible to the eye, but essential to chart my path. Constancy of purpose, often interpreted as emotional distance, was actually the manifestation of an unwavering dedication to a vision that only I could see.
              </p>
              <p>
                While Ally surrendered to the warmth of memories, I persisted in calculating my choices. Friendship, although challenged by the extremes of distance and change, became a board where every move was strategic and necessary. My return to Osternack, like a king stepping to the centre of the board, represented not just a move, but a set of silent sacrifices in pursuit of a greater goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we said goodbye, with the echo of Ally's steps towards another city, I recognized that, behind the apparent reserve, lay an appreciation for the complexity of the pieces that make up the narrative of life. Just like in chess, where each game is unique, my journey continued, forged by the sacrifices necessary to reach the checkmate that represented the next chapter in the great game of destiny.
