                In a secluded alley, I entered a remote pub to begin a private investigation of personal interest. My aim was Chevening, a woman with captivating appearance, hiding deep secrets behind her charming image. My objective? Collect crucial information to validate the investigation seeker's inferences.
              </p>
              <p>
                To gain Chevening's trust, I used persuasion techniques inspired by the FBI, following the "friendship formula" which is based on proximity, frequency, duration and intensity. Two months of dedicated application of these strategies not only cemented a bond of friendship but also revealed a hidden truth. I was intentionally the victim of dishonest conduct, something that, although foreseen, caught me unprepared. However, I left happy to have confronted my own truth. After all, not all discoveries are easy to digest, but each of them shapes our understanding of the world around us.

              <div class="post-thumb">

                Although everyone lies, we distinguish two main types of lies: those used for social maintenance and dishonest conduct, which seeks to deceive, stand out and manipulate others. The first, often harmless, is used to avoid embarrassment, while the second is characterized by specific criteria.
              </p>
              <p>Dishonest Conduct Criteria: An In-Depth Analysis</p>
              <h4>1.0 Deliberate Act of Deceiving Someone:</h4>
              <p>
                The "Deliberate Act of Deceiving Someone" refers to a lie that is purposefully designed with the intention of conveying false information. This type of lie involves prior planning on the part of the liar, who makes a conscious decision to deceive someone. Here are some additional aspects and considerations related to this criterion:
              </p>
              <p>
                Precedent Intention: Before uttering the lie, the individual already has the deliberate intention to deceive. This implies a conscious choice to communicate false information, often motivated by a specific goal, such as avoiding adverse consequences, obtaining personal advantage, or manipulating the perception of others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Planning and Control: The deliberate act suggests a certain degree of planning and control on the part of the liar. This is not an impulsive response, but rather a carefully thought-out strategy to achieve a desired outcome. The individual can consider in advance the possible ramifications of the lie and plan the best way to present it.
              </p>
              <h4>2.0 Consciousness of Falsehood:</h4>
              <p>
                The liar is aware of the falsity of the information he is about to communicate. This implies a clear understanding that the narrative they are constructing does not reflect the truth, thus differentiating it from incorrect information provided unintentionally.
              </p>
              <h4>3.0 Concealment Without Prior Notice:</h4>
              <p>
                "Dissimulation without prior warning" refers to a form of lying in which an individual chooses to deceive another person without warning them in advance about the falsity of the information. This criterion highlights the lack of transparency on the part of the liar, as they do not provide any indication that they are about to communicate misleading information.
              </p>
              <h4>4.0 Information Manipulation:</h4>
              <p>
                "Information Manipulation" involves different approaches, including lying by fabrication and lying by omission. Both are strategies used to distort the truth, but they operate in different ways:
              </p>
              <h5>Lie by Fabrication (To Falsify):</h5>
              <p>
                Definition: Lying by fabrication occurs when an individual actively modifies details or elements of an event or situation to create a false narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Example: Consider a case where a person reports an incident as part of an investigation. In the falsified version, it intentionally alters certain events or introduces fictitious elements to distort the truth. This may include adding people, places or actions that did not occur in reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Objective: The main objective of lying by fabrication is to alter the perception of events, often for one's own benefit or to manipulate the interpretation of others.
              </p>
              <h5>Lie by Omission (To Conceal):</h5>
              <p>Definition: Lying by omission occurs when an individual intentionally omits crucial information that, if revealed, would significantly alter the interpretation of events.</p>
              <p>Example: It is important to highlight that lying by omission is not always recognized immediately. To many, this may seem like a harmless answer or even a partial truth. However, upon closer examination of the context and intent behind the words, it becomes apparent that omitting crucial information is, in fact, a form of lying.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, lying by omission serves as a powerful reminder of the complexity of truth and the need for critical analysis of the information presented to us. By being aware of the subtleties of this type of manipulation, we can become more vigilant in seeking the complete truth and resisting the manipulation of reality.
              </p>
              <p>Objective: The main objective of lying by omission is to maintain control over the narrative, hiding information that could harm the liar's image or position.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h5>Additional Considerations:</h5>
              <p>Both forms of information manipulation involve a conscious distortion of the truth, one through the creation of fictitious elements and the other through the selective concealment of facts.</p>
              <p>In lying by fabrication, the individual is actively involved in constructing an alternative narrative, while in lying by omission, the focus is on cherry-picking what information to disclose.</p>
              <p>Both strategies can have ethical and moral implications, depending on the context in which they are used and the consequences that may result from manipulating information.</p>
              <p>Understanding these forms of information manipulation is crucial for critically analyzing reports and evaluating the reliability of information provided in different contexts.</p>
              <h4>5.0 Punishment/Reward Context:</h4>
              <p>Dishonest lies aim to avoid penalties or obtain benefits by creating a meaningful context.</p>
              <h4>6.0 High Stakes:</h4>
              <p>The concept of "High Stakes" in the context of analyzing deceptive behavior refers to the presence of situations in which there are significant consequences, whether in emotional, cognitive or social terms, associated with the detection of lies. Here are some key points related to "High Stakes":</p>
              <h5>Definition of High Stakes:</h5>
              <p>Critical Situations: High Stakes occur in critical situations in which decisions or actions based on the information provided can have substantial impacts on the lives of the people involved. This may include legal issues, personal relationships, reputation, among others.</p>
              <h5>Cognitive and Emotional Pressure:</h5>
              <p>High Cognitive and Emotional Load: In High Stakes situations, the cognitive and emotional pressure on the individual is intensified. The need to maintain a lie or hide the truth can create a significant mental burden, increasing the likelihood of nonverbal signs of incongruity.</p>
              <h5>Unconscious Reactions:</h5>
              <p>Signs of Incongruity: Under High Stakes, the body's unconscious reactions can manifest in ways that are difficult to control. Facial expressions, gestures, changes in body language, and other nonverbal cues may become more evident due to high emotional pressure.</p>
              <h3>SCANS Protocol:</h3>
              <p>Application of the SCANS Protocol: The SCANS protocol, with the 3-2-7 rule and the ABC filter, is a valuable tool for analyzing the incongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication. In High Stakes situations, strict application of this protocol can reveal patterns that indicate possible mistakes.</p>
              <h4>Importance of Contextual Assessment:</h4>
              <p>Specific Context: Interpreting High Stakes signals requires an in-depth understanding of the specific context in which interactions occur. The analysis must consider factors such as culture, social norms and the nature of the consequences at play.</p>
              <h4>Pressure Adaptation:</h4>
              <p>
                Individual Variation: Individuals may react differently to the pressure associated with High Stakes. Some may show greater ability to mask signs of lying, while others may reveal more inconsistencies under pressure.
            </p>
              <p>
                Understanding the concept of High Stakes is essential for professionals who seek to evaluate the veracity of information in critical contexts. Careful analysis of interactions during high-pressure situations can provide valuable insights into the presence of deceptive behaviors.
            </p>
              <p>
                Amid the intricate fabric of human relationships, where truths and lies intertwine, the concept of High Stakes emerges as a revealing beacon. Under the intense pressures of critical situations, our minds are shaped by the urgency of decisions that will have repercussions beyond the present moment. Analysis of deceptive behavior, guided by the SCANS protocol, provides us with a penetrating lens to uncover the nuances of truth and deception.
            </p>
              <p>
                In a world where lies cloak themselves in the shadows, it is crucial to understand that High Stakes not only reveals the tension in the threads of the lie, but also the resilience of the deceiver. It's not just about detecting inconsistencies, but about recognizing the complexity of the human mind under the weight of crucial choices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Closing this journey of reflection, let us remember that, amid the intricate plots of life, the truth is often subtle, while lies, not always so skillfully hidden, leave their marks. In a whisper of warning, the phrase that transcends these reflections echoes: "Don't believe her lies." This is the call to vigilance, the relentless search for clarity in a world shrouded in deception.
                May each analysis, each careful interpretation, be a flashlight to light the way through the labyrinth of dishonesty. Knowledge is the weapon, understanding the shield. May this understanding enable us to decipher the intertwined narratives of truth and discern the lies that sometimes disguise themselves in our own understanding.
