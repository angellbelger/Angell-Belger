              <p>
                I had just graduated from the police academy. As one of the top students throughout the entire training, my colleagues didn’t hesitate to assign me a complex first case—one that would test not only my skills but also my limits.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first glance, my mission seemed simple: investigate why several small and medium-sized business owners were dying under strange circumstances. Initially, it didn’t raise many alarms. But there was something that unsettled the authorities. Every time a business owner died, their competitors seemed to thrive. And for some reason, each case got quietly swept under the rug.
              </p>
              <p>
                Months went by before anyone noticed the pattern. But when they did, it became impossible to ignore. All the victims who underwent autopsies had something in common: a rare type of parasite found only in salmon. The kind that doesn’t survive heat—meaning the only way they could have been infected was through raw fish… sushi.
              </p>
              <p>
                The health department carried out inspections at every sushi restaurant in the city. As expected, they found nothing significant—just minor hygiene issues, nothing that could explain such fatal outcomes. And certainly nothing that connected a very specific group of victims.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s when I stepped in.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/chevening/outside.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center">
              </div>
              <p>
                I started visiting different restaurants, posing as a regular customer, observing, asking subtle questions. On my seventh stop… I met her.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chevening.
              </p>
              <p>
                A beautiful and charming girl, with a presence that was hard to ignore. Seductive, confident, and anything but discreet.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was at this exact moment that I began to apply my knowledge, according to the FBI's persuasion manual, the most efficient and effective method to approach and gain someone's trust, follows what they call the "friendship formula", which is based on proximity, frequency, duration and intensity. I spent 2 months applying this calmly and getting her attention as a result. Two months of dedicated application of these strategies not only cemented a bond of "friendship", but also revealed a hidden truth: it couldn't be anyone else. She wasn't an easy person to access (unless she was interested in you, but that's where the FBI strategy comes in). When I started to discover her interests, it became easier, because I was already behaving like a businessman, and as a consequence, behaving like prey too. Until then, any woman could be interested in a profile like that.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/chevening/meeting.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center">
              </div>
              <p>
                So, we naturally grew closer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually, I went as far as dating Chevening. I told her the truth—or at least part of it—that I was a police officer. It made her visibly nervous at first, but strangely enough… over time, her confidence seemed to grow. Almost like the danger excited her.
              </p>
              <p>
                But in the end… it was all part of the strategy. Getting as close as possible. Going deeper than anyone else ever had. Until her truth—whatever it really was—had nowhere left to hide.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/chevening/Tense-Night-in-Soft-Lighting.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center">
              </div>
              <p>
                Despite that, she became increasingly attached. She wanted to be around me all the time. I, on the other hand, kept my distance. I never gave her full access to me—always leaving just enough room for doubt, just enough space to keep her chasing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her more human side… that was the real problem. It kept breaking through the persona she wore so well. There were moments when she slipped—moments when vulnerability showed, when emotion surfaced. And every time that happened… I had to remind myself why I was there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sometimes, it became necessary to impose limits, to control the situation. Almost like dealing with an unruly inmate who doesn’t know when to stop.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/chevening/A-Tense-Moment-in-Soft-Light.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center">
              </div>
              <p>
                After a few months of this crazy relationship, I had gathered a lot of information, but nothing concrete enough to incriminate her—at least not until I found the syringe hidden in her purse in her apartment. This discovery made my heart race. I couldn’t wait to hand it over to the forensics team and confirm what I already suspected: she was the one injecting the parasites into the sushi.
              </p>
              <p>
                An almost perfect crime. Silent, slow, and difficult to trace—after all, these parasites could easily kill over time without raising immediate suspicion. That was her first real mistake. A rare moment of carelessness.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I was heading down the stairs, the power suddenly went out. I climbed to the top of the building to check if it was a general blackout. It wasn’t.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I turned my back for a second… she was there. Holding my gun. Pointing it at me.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her voice was cold but steady."I almost believed you," she said.
              </p>
              <p>
                I kept my eyes on her, choosing my words carefully. "We’re just playing a game… It’s nothing personal. People are dying, Chevening. What you’ve done… it’s much worse than what I did."That line hit her. I could see it.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the first moment I met her, even with all her talent for deception and manipulation, she was always expressive. Her body language… even when she lied, it betrayed her. But now… now I couldn’t read her at all. For the first time, I didn’t know what her expression meant. Then… she pulled the trigger. The impact hit me in the stomach. I dropped to the ground. She threw the gun beside me and ran. As my vision blurred and the darkness closed in, the last thing I saw was the stairwell light flickering… then everything went black.
              </p>

                I woke up in the hospital. My colleagues were standing around me, their faces a mix of concern and disappointment. "Well… looks like your first failure," one of them said, trying to sound light-hearted, but the weight of the words lingered. I forced a weak smile. "But I found her," I said. "It’s her. It was always her. "Alex, my closest colleague, shook his head. "And what’s the point?" he asked. "This is Brazil. There’s not enough material evidence to convict her. At best… we could charge her with attempted murder. And that’s assuming she even has a CPF… which she doesn’t" His tone turned bitter. "Her entire history… deleted. It’s like she never existed."

                Although everyone lies, we distinguish two main types of lies: those used for social maintenance and dishonest conduct, which seeks to deceive, stand out and manipulate others. The first, often harmless, is used to avoid embarrassment, while the second is characterized by specific criteria.
              </p>
              <p>Dishonest Conduct Criteria: An In-Depth Analysis</p>
              <h4>1.0 Deliberate Act of Deceiving Someone:</h4>
              <p>
                The "Deliberate Act of Deceiving Someone" refers to a lie that is purposefully designed with the intention of conveying false information. This type of lie involves prior planning on the part of the liar, who makes a conscious decision to deceive someone. Here are some additional aspects and considerations related to this criterion:
              </p>
              <p>
                Precedent Intention: Before uttering the lie, the individual already has the deliberate intention to deceive. This implies a conscious choice to communicate false information, often motivated by a specific goal, such as avoiding adverse consequences, obtaining personal advantage, or manipulating the perception of others.
              </p>
              <p>
                Planning and Control: The deliberate act suggests a certain degree of planning and control on the part of the liar. This is not an impulsive response, but rather a carefully thought-out strategy to achieve a desired outcome. The individual can consider in advance the possible ramifications of the lie and plan the best way to present it.
              </p>
              <h4>2.0 Consciousness of Falsehood:</h4>
              <p>
                The liar is aware of the falsity of the information he is about to communicate. This implies a clear understanding that the narrative they are constructing does not reflect the truth, thus differentiating it from incorrect information provided unintentionally.
              </p>
              <h4>3.0 Concealment Without Prior Notice:</h4>
              <p>
                "Dissimulation without prior warning" refers to a form of lying in which an individual chooses to deceive another person without warning them in advance about the falsity of the information. This criterion highlights the lack of transparency on the part of the liar, as they do not provide any indication that they are about to communicate misleading information.
              </p>
              <h4>4.0 Information Manipulation:</h4>
              <p>
                "Information Manipulation" involves different approaches, including lying by fabrication and lying by omission. Both are strategies used to distort the truth, but they operate in different ways:
              </p>
              <h5>Lie by Fabrication (To Falsify):</h5>
              <p>
                Definition: Lying by fabrication occurs when an individual actively modifies details or elements of an event or situation to create a false narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Example: Consider a case where a person reports an incident as part of an investigation. In the falsified version, it intentionally alters certain events or introduces fictitious elements to distort the truth. This may include adding people, places or actions that did not occur in reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Objective: The main objective of lying by fabrication is to alter the perception of events, often for one's own benefit or to manipulate the interpretation of others.
              </p>
              <h5>Lie by Omission (To Conceal):</h5>
              <p>Definition: Lying by omission occurs when an individual intentionally omits crucial information that, if revealed, would significantly alter the interpretation of events.</p>
              <p>Example: It is important to highlight that lying by omission is not always recognized immediately. To many, this may seem like a harmless answer or even a partial truth. However, upon closer examination of the context and intent behind the words, it becomes apparent that omitting crucial information is, in fact, a form of lying.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, lying by omission serves as a powerful reminder of the complexity of truth and the need for critical analysis of the information presented to us. By being aware of the subtleties of this type of manipulation, we can become more vigilant in seeking the complete truth and resisting the manipulation of reality.
              </p>
              <p>Objective: The main objective of lying by omission is to maintain control over the narrative, hiding information that could harm the liar's image or position.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h5>Additional Considerations:</h5>
              <p>Both forms of information manipulation involve a conscious distortion of the truth, one through the creation of fictitious elements and the other through the selective concealment of facts.</p>
              <p>In lying by fabrication, the individual is actively involved in constructing an alternative narrative, while in lying by omission, the focus is on cherry-picking what information to disclose.</p>
              <p>Both strategies can have ethical and moral implications, depending on the context in which they are used and the consequences that may result from manipulating information.</p>
              <p>Understanding these forms of information manipulation is crucial for critically analyzing reports and evaluating the reliability of information provided in different contexts.</p>
              <h4>5.0 Punishment/Reward Context:</h4>
              <p>Dishonest lies aim to avoid penalties or obtain benefits by creating a meaningful context.</p>
              <h4>6.0 High Stakes:</h4>
              <p>The concept of "High Stakes" in the context of analyzing deceptive behavior refers to the presence of situations in which there are significant consequences, whether in emotional, cognitive or social terms, associated with the detection of lies. Here are some key points related to "High Stakes":</p>
              <h5>Definition of High Stakes:</h5>
              <p>Critical Situations: High Stakes occur in critical situations in which decisions or actions based on the information provided can have substantial impacts on the lives of the people involved. This may include legal issues, personal relationships, reputation, among others.</p>
              <h5>Cognitive and Emotional Pressure:</h5>
              <p>High Cognitive and Emotional Load: In High Stakes situations, the cognitive and emotional pressure on the individual is intensified. The need to maintain a lie or hide the truth can create a significant mental burden, increasing the likelihood of nonverbal signs of incongruity.</p>
              <h5>Unconscious Reactions:</h5>
              <p>Signs of Incongruity: Under High Stakes, the body's unconscious reactions can manifest in ways that are difficult to control. Facial expressions, gestures, changes in body language, and other nonverbal cues may become more evident due to high emotional pressure.</p>
              <h3>SCANS Protocol:</h3>
              <p>Application of the SCANS Protocol: The SCANS protocol, with the 3-2-7 rule and the ABC filter, is a valuable tool for analyzing the incongruity between verbal and non-verbal communication. In High Stakes situations, strict application of this protocol can reveal patterns that indicate possible mistakes.</p>
              <h4>Importance of Contextual Assessment:</h4>
              <p>Specific Context: Interpreting High Stakes signals requires an in-depth understanding of the specific context in which interactions occur. The analysis must consider factors such as culture, social norms and the nature of the consequences at play.</p>
              <h4>Pressure Adaptation:</h4>
              <p>
                Individual Variation: Individuals may react differently to the pressure associated with High Stakes. Some may show greater ability to mask signs of lying, while others may reveal more inconsistencies under pressure.
            </p>
              <p>
                Understanding the concept of High Stakes is essential for professionals who seek to evaluate the veracity of information in critical contexts. Careful analysis of interactions during high-pressure situations can provide valuable insights into the presence of deceptive behaviors.
            </p>
              <p>
                Amid the intricate fabric of human relationships, where truths and lies intertwine, the concept of High Stakes emerges as a revealing beacon. Under the intense pressures of critical situations, our minds are shaped by the urgency of decisions that will have repercussions beyond the present moment. Analysis of deceptive behavior, guided by the SCANS protocol, provides us with a penetrating lens to uncover the nuances of truth and deception.
            </p>
              <p>
                In a world where lies cloak themselves in the shadows, it is crucial to understand that High Stakes not only reveals the tension in the threads of the lie, but also the resilience of the deceiver. It's not just about detecting inconsistencies, but about recognizing the complexity of the human mind under the weight of crucial choices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Closing this journey of reflection, let us remember that, amid the intricate plots of life, the truth is often subtle, while lies, not always so skillfully hidden, leave their marks. In a whisper of warning, the phrase that transcends these reflections echoes: "Don't believe her lies." This is the call to vigilance, the relentless search for clarity in a world shrouded in deception.
                May each analysis, each careful interpretation, be a flashlight to light the way through the labyrinth of dishonesty. Knowledge is the weapon, understanding the shield. May this understanding enable us to decipher the intertwined narratives of truth and discern the lies that sometimes disguise themselves in our own understanding.
