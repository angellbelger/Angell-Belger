              <p>
                On August 8, 2022, I returned to Osternack to face my last challenge. The trip was more than a geographic journey; it was the meticulous execution of plans and the reunion with family that permeated this experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                One particular night, as I was leaving a meeting at the mall, I decided to call an Uber to my next destination. While I was waiting, a stranger approached me with an unusual compliment about my coat, comparing me to former President Donald Trump. Aware that such compliments often precede requests, I remained cautious.
              </p>
              <div class="post-thumb">
                <img src="../img/storytelling/angellbelger_well-dressed_young_man_18_years_old_in_the_rain_wi_cf8d3cba-e48d-4568-9ec9-404879803f85.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <p>
                The stranger, realizing my intention to call a taxi, asked to share the trip. I replied that this decision would be up to the driver, and he remained nearby. Taking advantage of a moment of his distraction, I discreetly walked around him, observing his posture and facial expression for clues about his intentions.
              </p>
              <p>
                I focused on details like the possible presence of a weapon, analyzing waist height. Discreet observation led me to discard this hypothesis, since his clothing did not suggest the presence of visible weapons on the upper part of his body. I then tried to determine whether he was right-handed or left-handed, considering the potential risk of a serve. The difficulty in identifying the dominant arm indicated an uncertainty that added a layer of complexity to the enigma.
              </p>
              <p>
                When trying to see if he was wearing a watch, I came across the limitation of long sleeves, making it impossible to draw a precise conclusion. The meeting, although brief, triggered a series of analyses, illustrating the constant readiness to face the unknown in search of security and discernment.
              </p>
              <p>
                After calling the taxi, the stranger unceremoniously entered the car. During the trip, surprisingly, he revealed that he owned a 9mm gun, contrary to my previous analysis that had ruled out this possibility. Confused, I remained silent, pondering the true intentions of that unexpected passenger.
              </p>
              <p>
                When declaring his real intentions, I considered arresting him, supported by my police power. At that moment, I assumed a more aggressive, although discreet, stance. His suspicious looks indicated that he might notice something out of the ordinary. The intriguing question about my occupation made me hesitate before answering.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Mother fu***... I'm a fu**ing full-stack. - Mysterious man</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                "I work as a software engineer," I said, a partial truth that omitted my broader role. His eyes, filled with disdain, cast judgment. With a pause, he continued, revealing himself to be a full-stack and expressing a peculiar mixture of respect and displeasure.
              </p>
              <p>
                This brief dialogue, which unfolded over the course of a single trip, forced me to employ techniques of persuasion, behavioral analysis and non-verbal communication. Although tempted to act in the face of the threat, my decision was to leave the resolution to local authorities, considering the distance from my jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uncertainty about the weapon's presence hung like a shadow in my mind, challenging confidence in my sharp analysis. Even though I had a mental palace that, countless times, provided me with clarity in my investigations, the heat of the moment made me doubt myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Revisiting the scene over and over in my mind, I delved into the nuances of that tense encounter. Every detail of the original analysis was dissected and examined in light of different perspectives. Emotions rose, reflecting the tension of a decision that could have significant impacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, as I retraced the steps of that strange dialogue, my confidence in my initial conclusion resurfaced. He wasn't armed; he was just having fun, a subtle psychological game that I myself had used in several past investigations. The heat of the moment did not cloud my analytical ability; on the contrary, it revealed the resilience of the trust that sustains my mental palace.
